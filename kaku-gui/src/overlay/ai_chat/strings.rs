//! User-visible strings for the Cmd+L AI overlay.
//!
//! Backed by `rust-i18n`. The accessor functions return `String` (not
//! `&'static str`) because the underlying lookup is runtime; callers
//! should clone-on-use rather than try to borrow these for `'static`
//! contexts. Long-form templates that interpolate values still live next
//! to their `format!` call sites — extract them only when they ship as
//! standalone labels.
//!
//! Translation source: `locales/{en,zh-CN}.yml`, scope `ai`.
