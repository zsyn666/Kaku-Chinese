# FAQ

## Is there a Windows or Linux version?

Not currently. Kaku is macOS-only while the macOS experience is being polished. Windows and Linux may come later.

## Can I use a transparent window?

Yes. Add to `~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`:

```lua
local config = require("kaku").config
config.window_background_opacity = 0.92
config.macos_window_background_blur = 20  -- optional blur, 0–100
return config
```

## How do I switch the interface to Simplified Chinese?

Set `config.language` to `"zh-CN"` and relaunch:

```lua
config.language = "zh-CN"
```

Use `"auto"` to follow `$LC_ALL` / `$LC_MESSAGES` / `$LANG` from your
shell. See [configuration.md#language](configuration.md#language) for
details, including which surfaces are translated and which (e.g. the
macOS system menu bar) follow the OS instead.

## How do I turn off copy on select?

```lua
config.copy_on_select = false
```

## How do I customize keybindings?

Append to `config.keys`, do not replace it:

```lua
config.keys[#config.keys + 1] = {
  key = "RightArrow",
  mods = "CMD|SHIFT",
  action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection("Right"),
}
```

See [keybindings.md](keybindings.md) and [configuration.md](configuration.md) for more examples.

## Can I control working directory inheritance?

Yes, individually for windows, tabs, and splits:

```lua
config.window_inherit_working_directory = true
config.tab_inherit_working_directory = true
config.split_pane_inherit_working_directory = true
```

All are enabled by default.

## How do I disable Kaku Assistant?

Run `kaku ai`, open Kaku Assistant settings, and set Enabled to Off. Or edit `~/.config/kaku/assistant.toml` directly:

```toml
enabled = false
```

## How do I use a custom LLM provider?

Run `kaku ai`, keep Auth Type set to API key, and enter your Base URL, API Key, Simple Model, and Deep Model manually. The URL must be OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/chat/completions`).

## How do I restore default config?

```bash
kaku reset
```

This removes Kaku-managed shell and tmux integration, Kaku-managed git delta
defaults, selected Kaku state, and managed theme blocks in
`~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`. User-authored Lua outside managed blocks is
preserved. Run `kaku init` again if you want shell integration back.

## The `kaku` command is missing. How do I recover it?

```bash
/Applications/Kaku.app/Contents/MacOS/kaku init --update-only
exec zsh -l
```

Then run `kaku doctor` to verify everything is healthy.

## How do I use Kaku's CLI from scripts?

```bash
kaku cli split-pane
kaku cli split-pane -- bash -c "echo hello"
kaku cli --help
```

See [cli.md](cli.md) for full reference.

## How do I enable the scrollbar?

Open `kaku config` and toggle the scrollbar option, or add to `~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`:

```lua
config.enable_scroll_bar = true
```

## How do I scroll inside nano, vim, or another full-screen terminal app?

Enable alternate-screen wheel forwarding:

```lua
config.alternate_screen_wheel_scrolls_terminal = true
```

## How do I change the font? My font change isn't taking effect.

Font changes require explicitly setting `config.font` in your config:

```lua
config.font = wezterm.font('Your Font Name')
```

Note: Kaku's theme-aware font weight system only applies to the default JetBrains Mono stack. Once you set a custom font, Kaku will no longer override its weight automatically.

## My `window_padding` change isn't working.

`window_padding` values require a `'px'` unit suffix:

```lua
config.window_padding = { left = '24px', right = '24px', top = '40px', bottom = '20px' }
```

Plain numbers (without `'px'`) are interpreted as terminal cell units, which may not match your intent.

## The screen jumps to the top while Claude Code is generating output.

This is a known interaction between trackpad scroll and Claude Code's streaming output. If you accidentally scroll to the top mid-stream, pressing the down arrow or scrolling back down returns you to the current output. A fix for the jump behavior has been tracked and shipped in recent releases.

## Cmd+Shift+Y sends a local path when inside an SSH session.

The yazi remote-files feature (`Cmd+Shift+R`) is designed for SSH sessions and mounts the remote filesystem via sshfs. `Cmd+Shift+Y` is for local yazi. Use `Cmd+Shift+R` when you are inside an SSH pane.

## The `y` shell wrapper doesn't sync my directory on exit.

Make sure the Kaku fish/zsh shell integration is sourced. Check with `kaku doctor`. The `y` wrapper requires the shell init to be loaded. A bare `yazi` call will not sync the directory.

## Homebrew can't find the binary / wrong Kaku gets updated.

There is an older unrelated package named `kaku` on Homebrew. Install Kaku with the tap to avoid conflicts:

```bash
brew install tw93/tap/kakuku
```

If you see checksum errors with `kaku update`, use `brew upgrade tw93/tap/kakuku` directly.

## Claude Code notifications don't appear.

Kaku's notification permission may not be granted. Go to System Settings > Notifications > Kaku and enable Allow Notifications. Then restart Kaku.

## The global hotkey doesn't work on non-QWERTY keyboards (e.g. Colemak).

`Cmd + Opt + Ctrl + K` uses the physical QWERTY K position. On Colemak, this corresponds to a different key. Remap it in your config:

```lua
table.insert(config.keys, {
  key = 'k',  -- adjust to your layout's physical key
  mods = 'CMD|OPT|CTRL',
  action = wezterm.action.EmitEvent('toggle-global-window'),
})
```

## QR codes and terminal graphics look vertically stretched.

Kaku's default `line_height = 1.28` favors comfortable text spacing. Terminal graphics built from characters, such as QR codes, `neofetch` logos, and TUI bar charts, scale with the row height, so they render about 28% taller than in terminals with no extra line spacing. This is a typography trade-off, not a rendering bug: block characters must fill the whole cell so TUI borders and progress bars stay seamless.

If you want near-square graphics, lower the line height in `~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`:

```lua
config.line_height = 1.1  -- or 1.0 to match terminals without extra spacing
```

Note that no terminal renders half-block QR codes perfectly square: with common monospace fonts the cell is naturally a bit taller than 2:1 even at `line_height = 1.0`.

## Can I use Kaku with tiling window managers (yabai, AeroSpace)?

Kaku is compatible with yabai and AeroSpace. If you see continuous flickering, it is usually caused by the tiling WM fighting with Kaku's fullscreen/resize logic. Disabling Kaku's native fullscreen (`config.native_macos_fullscreen_mode = false`) or excluding Kaku from the tiling WM's managed window list typically resolves it.
